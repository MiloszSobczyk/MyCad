- Add interface layer for initialization, viewports etc.
- Add a simple command line interface for commands.
- Add InputSystem that updates the raw input state. That input state is later used by other systems.
- Add IConfigManager.
- Add ChangedComponent that can be used to track changes in components.
- Add possibility to assign uniform and buffer to renderer in some better way.
- Add a system that allows for creating only one vertex array object per e.g. PointMesh, so it can be reused.


InputSystem handles the input state we receive and can be used by other systems.

TransformSystem has different transforms that can be applied to entites, such as ScalingSystem, etc.
ScalingSystem is an interface that can be used to scale entites, e.g. UniformScalingSystem, PointScalingSystem.
It uses Strategy design pattern to allow different scaling strategies.
Use ImGuizmos for using gizmos, thus removing the need for distinsguishing x y z axes.
